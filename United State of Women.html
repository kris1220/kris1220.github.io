            <h5> House of Marley</h5>
            <h1> the rhythm of digital retail.</h1>
            <h6>
                Deeply rooted in principles of charity and eco-consciousness, House of
                Marley makes premium headphones and speakers that not only embody these tenets,
                but are also well-designed and easy to use.

                A challenger brand with a legacy to love up to, House of Marley has a
                strong vision and product catalog, but their previous site design didn't do
                the brand justice. Facing steep competition in a market oversaturated
                with slick, celeb-backed audio gear, the brand looked to DOMANI to increase
                conversions through a complete overhaul of their e-commerce site both here in
                the US and in markets abroad.

            Smart design stays a step ahead.

            With the site’s design and buy-flow not performing at its best, we needed to create a destination that would
            better convey the brand’s full-steam-ahead trajectory and ultimately drive more business.
            <br>
            <br>
            In order to take the brand to the next level, we created a Magento powered framework with sales
            conversion as a priority focus. The revamped design features an easy-to-use navigation and product category
            structure, a simplified layout with clean typography and bold imagery, and a quicker path to purchase.

        Smart UX and eye catching design is a
        great start, but driving conversion hinges
        on maintaining an adaptive SEM
        and CRM strategy - both are services
        DOMANI typically covers for eComm clients.
