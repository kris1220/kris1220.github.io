               <h3> A WORLD BELOW THE SURFACE.</h3>

                  A major attraction on the Boston waterfront, the New England Aquarium (NEAQ) faced
                large crowds<br> and found itself ill-equipped for the massive lines packing in visitors
                like sardines. Tourists and <br>residents alike were trying to access information about
                NEAQ through their mobile devices, but due<br> to an outdated site, they were unable to
                do so without frustration.<br><br>
               The NEAQ wanted to create an efficient and simple digital platform for local tourists and
                visitors, and<br> so they looked to DOMANI to build a mobile site that would help users plan a
                visit and guide them <br>while on site at the aquarium.
